# Advent of Code, 2020
This is my 2nd attempt at using OCaml for AoC. Last time I did think, I think it was 2 years ago, and I came away frustrated, not knowing how to instantiate a hashtable with integral keys.

So far, by **Day 2**, I've still spent the majority of the time messing around with my environment because it wasn't ready and a lot of it had to be updated and figured out from scratch.

I got it all to almost work, though:
- Catalina
- Visual Studio Code
- OCaml 4.11.11
- OPAM 2.0.7
- Dune 2.7.1
- OCaml Platform extension - it was angry for a while, until I deleted my older, default switch and found where it was being used in the settings.json 

## Day 3
Solved Part 1 with my 10-year-old, pair programming. He was really bored. I understand.

## Day 4
Part 2 was a lot of work, for weeknight fun. Installed PCRE and wrote the validation code. The code worked on first try, though, so that's good.
Still hoping to start at 9PM sharp. Today, started around 9:25 or so.
