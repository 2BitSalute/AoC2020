# Advent of Code, 2020
This is my 2nd attempt at using OCaml for AoC. Last time I did think, I think it was 2 years ago, and I came away frustrated, not knowing how to instantiate a hashtable with integral keys.

So far, by day 2, I've still spent the majority of the time messing around with my environment because it wasn't ready and a lot of it had to be updated and figured out from scratch.

I got it all to almost work, though:
- Catalina
- Visual Studio Code
- OCaml 4.11.11
- OPAM 2.0.7
- Dune 2.7.1
- OCaml Platform extension - it was angry for a while, until I deleted my older, default switch and found where it was being used in the settings.json
